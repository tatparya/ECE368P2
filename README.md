# ECE368 Project 2: Sorting Algorithms

<h5>This project is a part of the Course ECE 368: Data Structures and Algorithms</h5>

<b>Objective:</b><br>
	Sort a given list of integers using
	an efficient sorting algorithm.

<b>Criteria:</b><br>
	The sort algorithm was to be tested
	against other students and the grades
	for the project assigned according to
	the execution time of the algorithm

<b>Compile Command:</b>
```<bash>
	gcc -Wall project2.c project2_test.c
```
<b>Test commands for terminal:</b>
```<bash>
	gcc -Wall testCode.c
	time ./a.out {arg}
```
