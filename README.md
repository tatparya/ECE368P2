ECE368 Project: Sorting Algorithms

This project is a part of the Course ECE 368: Data Structures and Algorithms

Objective:
    Sort a given list of integers using
    an efficient sorting algorithm.

Criteria:
    The sort algorithm was to be tested
    against other students and the grades
    for the project assigned according to
    the execution time of the algorithm

Compile Command:
    gcc -Wall project2.c project2_test.c

Test commands for terminal

    gcc -Wall testCode.c
    time ./a.out {arg}
